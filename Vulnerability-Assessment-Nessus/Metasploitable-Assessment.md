# Metasploitable Vulnerability Assessment Report
Author: Martin Inyang  
Tool: Tenable Nessus Essentials  
Date: 2025  
Target: Metasploitable 2 (Intentionally Vulnerable Linux VM)  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
A vulnerability assessment was conducted on a Metasploitable 2 machine using Tenable Nessus Essentials.  
A total of **69 vulnerabilities** were identified, spanning multiple severity levels including **Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational**.

This assessment demonstrates proficiency in:
- Vulnerability scanning  
- Interpreting CVSS scores  
- Identifying high-risk services  
- Prioritizing remediation steps  
- Understanding exploit paths  
- Documenting findings professionally  

Metasploitable is intentionally vulnerable, making it ideal for hands-on learning.  
This report summarizes major findings and presents actionable remediation guidance.

## 2. Scan Overview

**Scanner:** Nessus Essentials  
**Policy:** Basic Network Scan  
**Scan Type:** Authenticated/Unauthenticated (depending on setup)  
**Duration:** Approx. 18 minutes  
**Target:** Metasploitable 2 VM  
**Discovered Services:**  
- HTTP  
- SSH  
- FTP  
- Samba  
- Telnet  
- RPC

## 3. Severity Breakdown

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | 4 | Bind Shell Backdoor, VNC Password Detection |
| **High** | 7 | Samba Badlock, SSL Multiple Issues |
| **Medium** | 15 | TLS 1.0 Detection, Anonymous Cipher Support |
| **Low** | 20+ | Weak configurations |
| **Info** | Remaining | Service detections |

Critical and high vulnerabilities indicate **remote exploitation potential** and **major misconfigurations**.

## 4. Key Findings (Based on Scan Results)

### **1. Bind Shell Backdoor Detection — Critical**
- A bind shell was detected, allowing remote attackers to execute commands.
- **Risk:** Full remote compromise  
- **Fix:** Remove unauthorized shell; reinstall OS if needed.

---

### **2. VNC Server 'Password' Password — Critical**
- Weak VNC password ("password") detected.
- **Risk:** Remote access takeover  
- **Fix:** Disable VNC or set a complex password.

---

### **3. SSL v2/v3 Protocol Detection — High**
- Obsolete cryptographic protocols in use.
- **Risk:** Susceptible to MITM attacks  
- **Fix:** Disable SSLv2, SSLv3; enforce TLS 1.2/1.3.

---

### **4. Apache Tomcat Multiple Issues — High**
- Outdated version with known vulnerabilities.
- **Risk:** Code execution, privilege escalation  
- **Fix:** Update or remove Tomcat server.

---

### **5. Samba Badlock Vulnerability — High**
- Linux Samba service affected by Badlock bug.
- **Risk:** Remote code execution or spoofing  
- **Fix:** Update Samba to patched version.

---

### **6. Unencrypted Telnet Service — Medium**
- Telnet transmits credentials in plaintext.
- **Risk:** Credential theft  
- **Fix:** Disable Telnet; use SSH only.

---

### **7. SSL Anonymous Cipher Suites Supported — Medium**
- Weak SSL/TLS configuration.
- **Risk:** MITM or session hijacking  
- **Fix:** Disable anonymous cipher suites.

---

## 5. Remediation Recommendations

### **Priority 1 — Critical**
1. Remove bind shell + check system integrity  
2. Update/remove VNC service  
3. Patch Tomcat & Samba  

### **Priority 2 — High**
4. Disable SSLv2/SSLv3  
5. Enforce secure cipher suites  
6. Apply system updates  

### **Priority 3 — Medium/Low**
7. Disable Telnet  
8. Enforce secure configurations  
9. Apply CIS baselines  
10. Re-scan after remediation
